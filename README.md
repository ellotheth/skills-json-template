# skills-json-template
Default template for skills.json, goal is to help connect projects with contributors.

Maintainers can utilize this file to specify what skills are needed to contribute to a project. By identifying this information, and storing it in a JSON file, we are able to parse this information in the future and provide easily searchable skill listings for repositories and lower the bar to entry for developers searching to become contributors.
